# Intro

I am currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at University of California, Irvine and working as a Senior Software Developer at Next Generation Robotics (NGR). Before NGR, I worked as an SDE at AWS in the Aurora DB team. I completed my undergrad at National Institute of Technology, Karnataka. In my spare time, I read tech blogs on Medium. I plan to start writing Medium blogs in the near future. If you think I can be helpful to you or your organization and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.

# Note

I am graduating in December 2023, and looking for full-time opportunities as a Software Developer starting December 2023 or early 2024. I am interested in Full Stack development (Backend focused) and Infrastructure Engineer roles. I am open to exploring new roles and domains too, and I am a quick learner!
